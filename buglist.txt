1. The peekFront() method returns elements in a First-in-last-out order,
just like a stack. The correct order should be first-in-first-out. This could
be an issue of the peekFront() method if we assume that the enqueue() method 
is implemented correctly. It could also be an issue of the enqueue() method, if
we assume that the peekFront() method is implemented correctly.

2. The dequeue() method's '@return' documentation comment says that it should 
return the value of the entry at the front of the queue, but it returns void.

3. Using the valgrind program to test for memory leaks, it is found that there is
heap-allocated memory used by the Queue class that is not freed. Hence, the Queue
class has memory leaks.
