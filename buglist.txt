1. The peekFront() method returns elements in a First-in-last-out order, just like a stack. The correct order should be first-in-first-out. This could be an issue of the peekFront() method if we assume that the enqueue() and dequeue() methods are implemented correctly. It could also be an issue of the enqueue() method, if we assume that the peekFront() and dequeue() methods are implemented correctly. Lastly, it could be an issue of dequeue(), if we assume that enqueue() and peekFront() are correct.

2. The dequeue() method's '@return' documentation comment says that it should return the value of the entry at the front of the queue, but it returns void.

3. Using the valgrind program to test for memory leaks, it is found that there is heap-allocated memory used by the Queue class that is not freed. Hence, the Queue class has memory leaks.
